### 🕹️ About the Project

This is a simple but fun implementation of the classic **Hangman** game using **MATLAB**, developed as part of a university project. The goal was to apply core MATLAB programming and software development principles to build an interactive application with visual state updates and a clean user experience.

---

### 📌 Features

- Interactive **user input** and output handling in the command window
- Dynamic **visual representation** of game state via:
  - ASCII-style game board
  - Visual tracking of guessed letters and remaining lives
- Modular code written with **functions** and logical structure
- Easy-to-read code with **clean formatting** and **meaningful comments**

---

### 🧠 Core Concepts Applied

This project demonstrates application of the following MATLAB programming and software development concepts:

#### Programming Concepts
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Vectors and matrices
- Conditional execution (`if`, `else`, `switch`)
- Function decomposition and modularity

#### Software Development Practices
- Clear **commenting** and consistent **code style**
- **Incremental development** and testing strategy
- Usage of **documentation** for function descriptions and logic explanation
- Emphasis on code **readability** and maintainability

---

### Learning Outcomes

- Building a text-based game using **structured logic**
- Using **MATLAB visualization tools** to represent dynamic application states
- Practicing **good coding habits** like documentation and modular design
- Gaining confidence in **explaining code** and **design decisions**

### 💡 Future Improvements

- GUI version using **App Designer**
- Custom word list from file input
- Difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard)
- Score tracking and leaderboard
